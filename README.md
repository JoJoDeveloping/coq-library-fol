# Coq Library for First-Order Logic

This library collects several results about concerning first-order logic (FOL) that have been mechanised over the span of several projects. To get started, follow the installation instructions below and import one of the summary files in the [theories](theories) folder, for instance the file [FullSyntax.v](theories/FullSyntax.v) providing all necessary definitions regarding syntax, natural deduction systems, and semantics. There are also summary files for specific theories, for instance [Arithmetics.v](theories/Arithmetics.v) providing the usual systems like PA and Q. Don't hesitate to contact the maintainers if you need help!

Note that the core definitions and results of FOL are included in the [Coq library of undecidability proofs](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability), specifically the [theories/FOL](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability/tree/coq-8.16/theories/FOL) folder and its subfolders on [Syntax](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability/tree/coq-8.16/theories/FOL/Syntax), [Deduction](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability/tree/coq-8.16/theories/FOL/Deduction), and [Semantics](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability/tree/coq-8.16/theories/FOL/Semantics). With this distribution, all content regarding undecidability is natively placed in the undecidability library.

The FOL library currently extends this core with the following content:

- [Deduction](theories/Deduction): More deduction systems not included in the core library.
- [Semantics](theories/Semantics): More semantics not included in the core library.
- [Completeness](theories/Completeness): Completeness results for Tarski, Kripke, and algebraic semantics, constructive where possible.
- [Incompleteness](theories/Incompleteness): An abstract and synthetic version of the first incompleteness theorem, instantiated to Robinson's Q.
- [Tennenbaum](theories/Tennenbaum): Tennenbaum's theorem stating that the natural numbers are the only computable model of PA, constructivised.
- [ArithmeticalHierachy](theories/ArithmeticalHierarchy): Semantic and syntactic characterisations of the arithmetical hierarchy and an equivalence proof.
- [Proofmode](theories/Proofmode): A tool easing derivations in a deduction system, including a HOAS input language hiding de Bruijn encoded syntax.
- [Reification](theories/Reification): A tactic automating representability proofs of Coq predicates as first-order formulas.
- [Utils](theories/Utils): A collection of additional results needed in various projects.

## Installation

### As a Library User

This library is available in opam. To install it, you can use the following commands:

```
opam switch create coq-library-fol --packages=ocaml-variants.4.14.1+options,ocaml-option-flambda
eval $(opam env)
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam update
opam install coq-library-fol
```

### As a Library Developer

First, clone this repostitory. Then, run the following commands:

```
opam switch create . --packages=ocaml-variants.4.14.1+options,ocaml-option-flambda --deps-only --repos=default,coq-released=https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
make
```

This should automatically build the library. If you are working on a "pre-release" version, you might need the following `--repos` flag:
```
--repos=default,coq-core-dev=https://coq.inria.fr/opam/core-dev,coq-extra-dev=https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev,coq-released=https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
```
